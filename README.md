## What?

Developing smart contracts for the NEO blockchain requires a local 
[private network](https://hub.docker.com/r/cityofzion/neo-privatenet/) to be running. This project 
sets this up for you, along with a number of other utility [services](#services) to help with development.

## Install

Before being able to use **neo-local**, you will need to install **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.

For MacOS and Windows users, both are bundled together:

- [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

For Linux users, you will have two seperate things to install:

1. [Docker (Community Edition)](https://store.docker.com/search?offering=community&operating_system=linux&q=&type=edition)
1. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)

## Usage

MacOS or Linux users can make use of the **Makefile**:

```
make start
```
```
make stop
```

Windows users must run the **Docker commands manually**:

```
docker-compose up -d --build --remove-orphans
```
```
docker exec -it neo-python np-prompt -p -v
```

## Block Explorer

View what is happening on your local blockchain: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

## Services

The [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) stack is made up of the following
services:

- [neo-privatenet](https://hub.docker.com/r/cityofzion/neo-privatenet/) (consensus nodes)
- [neo-python](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python) (development CLI)
- [neo-scan](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-scan) (block explorer)
- [postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) (database for neo-scan)
- (coming sooon) [neo-faucet](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-faucet)

## Troubleshooting

If you have an issue then please contact any of the 
[contributors](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-local/graphs/contributors) on the 
[NEO Discord](https://discord.cityofzion.io), or create an [issue](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-local/issues/new).

The **Makefile** is designed to simplify the setup process, however in doing so it can 
obscure debugging. Thus it is recommended to run the Docker commands manually if you encounter 
an error (as outlined in [usage](#usage)).

## Credit

[@slipo](https://github.com/slipo) used Docker Compose to create a simpler
local development environment (see [repo](https://github.com/slipo/neo-scan-docker)). His work was built 
upon by the [NeoAuth](https://github.com/neoauth) team, who simplified the idea
further with the use of a wrapper and renamed the project.

It has now moved to be a part of CoZ and is actively maintained by the team - see 
[contributors](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-local/graphs/contributors).

**Note** - this project sits on the shoulders of a number of great CoZ projects, and wouldn't be 
possible without their hard work (see [services](#services)).
